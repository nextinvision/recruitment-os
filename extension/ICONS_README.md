# Extension Icons

This extension requires icon files for the Chrome extension. You need to create or add the following icon files:

## Required Icons

Place these files in the `icons/` directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Solution

For development, you can create simple placeholder icons:

1. Create a 128x128 PNG image with your logo/branding
2. Resize it to create the other sizes (48x48 and 16x16)
3. Place all three files in the `icons/` directory

## Online Tools

You can use online tools to generate icons:
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)

## Temporary Placeholder

If you just need to test the extension, you can:
1. Create a simple colored square image
2. Save it as PNG in all three sizes
3. Place them in the `icons/` directory

The extension will work without proper icons, but Chrome will show a default icon.
