# Testing Chrome Extension Without Manual Loading

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Unit Tests with Mocks (Recommended)
Test individual components and modules with mocked Chrome APIs.

### Option 2: Component Testing
Test React components in isolation.

### Option 3: Automated Browser Testing
Use Puppeteer/Playwright to automate Chrome and test the extension.

### Option 4: Test HTML Page
Create a standalone HTML page to test popup components.

Let me set up all these options for you.
